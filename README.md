End-Of-Term Assignment :: GoogleEarthTweetMapper
------------------------------------------------

The program takes Twitter data stored in a CSV file locally on the computer
and visualizes them as a Google-Earth kml file together with a Ground-Overlay
element as basemap that can be retrieved from an OGC-WMS request. The Java source
code together with the Ecelipse class and project paths is provided, thus, you
should be able to open and run the project in Eclipse when cloning or forking from
GitHub.

Please note that Google Earth Pro must be installed on your computer (Windows or
Ubuntu) to successfully run the program.

Make also sure that your internet connection is stable as otherwise the WMS request
might fail due to Socket-TimeOut exceptions.

A detailed description of the program's structure and its functionanility can be
found in the attached pdf-file containing the documentation.

If you encounter any difficulties to run the program please let us know.
