To do:

	Stefan: make KML ground-overlay using the downloaded image (result from WMS request)
		insert the extracted tweets into kml structure
		=> create kml structure and store it as *.kml file (you can use String variable to specify the storage directory -> this info comes from the user)

	Levente:extract the tweets from the CSV and store in a array -> should be used by Stefan for his class
		start GoogleEarth with the kml from Stefan

	Lukas: create WMS-Request and store the result as image locally (actually done but WMS is a nasty beast...)
	       create main method to perform all required steps (incl. GUI)
